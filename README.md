# BookRentalApplication
In this application, shopkeeper can rent the book to the customer for certain period. Shopkeeper can add/delete the customer details which will be added as member of that bookshop. Shopkeeper can update the status of the book once it is Borrowed/Return by the customer. I have used Angular JS, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to implement this project.
