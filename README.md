# BookRentalApplication
By using this application, Shopkeeper can rent the book to the customer for certain time period and can track the status of the book. This is kind of "Library Management System". It calculates the rent amount automatically based on number of days the book is borrowed. Customers will be added as members of that bookshop. Shopkeeper can update the status of the books once it is Borrowed/Returned by the customer. 

It gives you feel of Single Page Application as it is designed using Angular JS. Bootstrap's features makes this application adaptable to any device or browser. Currently application reads the book details from JSON file but later it can be changed to read it from database.

More functionalities can be easily added in future because of its modular design.

Technologies Used:- Angular JS | JSON | Bootstrap | HTML | CSS.
